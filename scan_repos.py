            # Since API doesnâ€™t directly give creator, one workaround is to check repo 'owner' + 'permissions' + contributors.

            # Let's filter repos where the user is listed as the repo owner or in contributors (a more advanced approach).
            # For simplicity, assume if repo name contains your username (or use other logic).
            # You can adapt this based on your GitHub setup.

            # Simple heuristic: Check if 'owner' is your username (won't work for org repos)
            # So just list all repos here; filtering can be enhanced.
